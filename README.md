**GeoSynth** (Stands for Geometric Synthosizer) is an in-browser application that allows you to play and analyse music visually. 

The app can be used as a musical education tool, a midi player/visualizer, a midi interface that can both input and output to connected instruments, or even an instrument in it's own right.  

There are several *toys* (widgets) that allow for different ways to visualize notes and how they fit into the key and harmony of a song. Understanding the layout of these *toys* helps build a visual/geometric intution for music theory.  

You can learn the shape of chords; you can visualize why certain chord progressions work; you can reason geometrically about key changes, you can find inspiration for song writing; you can develop a whole new way of thinking about music.  

I hope you enjoy my passion project.
Thank you for checking it out!
